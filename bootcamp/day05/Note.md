Looks like we got some trees to tackle.

task00 and task01 look like we focuse on working with trees using breath-first, and depth-first tree retrival alogirthms.

task02 focuses on using heaps like max and min heaps.

task03 we learn about knapsack problem and it's solutions. We can improve it's performance by implementing cache (memoization) which I didn't have time to finish. mayle I'll add it in the future.
