ex00: working with unsafe pointeres
ex01: reflection
ex02: calling c functions from golang. 

In ex02 I was supposed to use the given source code in ../materials/window.zip but the code works only on MacOs. I'm on Linux.
And my desktop enviroment is X11 so I just rewrote the same code for x11 in C and called it from my go program :)
