Don't copy the solutions, they might be wrong. Read them, learn and rewrite.

## Note
These are my solutions to Golang intensive bootcamp tasks at Schol21.
The day00 is where my journey started, don't judge. I know this is sh.tty code.
I only have time to learn go after a full time work so I sometimes just don't refactor as long as it works :)
I will love to hear constructive feedback.

## Structure
* Day00 is very first task and other tasks will also have the same naming convetion respectively. day[N]
* Each directory contains the task as a README.md file and maybe some of my notes for the task as a NOTES.md file.
* There are/will be two team projects. Namingly Team0 and Team1.
